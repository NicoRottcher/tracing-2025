# Repository for: Tracing Iridium Dissolution Pathways in Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers at Relevant Current Densities in Real Time

Accompanying repository for the publication: Nico C. Röttcher, J. Zhou, L. Löttert, Karl J. J. Mayrhofer, and Dominik Dworschak "Tracing Iridium Dissolution Pathways in Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers at Relevant Current Densities in Real Time", 2025, submitted.

The repository will includes:

- Raw data of the experiments discussed troughout the publication as SQLite database file
- Analysis routines
- Visualization routines for the figures displayed in the publication
- Interactive exploration of data and routines using Binder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/NicoRottcher/tracing-2025/HEAD)

The repository is based on a previously published data management:
